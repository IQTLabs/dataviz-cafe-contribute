With over 700 libraries/frameworks catalogued in this latest release, [dataviz.cafe](https://dataviz.cafe/) was built to help creative coders, data scientists, and visualization designers to do their jobs more effectively. Our goal is to help practitioners find high quality, low-cost visualization resources to support a wide variety of use-cases.

From general-purpose frameworks to specialized libraries for visualizing brain structures, satellite orbits, and electrical grids (to name just a few), each tool in the collection is summarized, illustrated with a screenshot, and systematically tagged by data type, programming language, and content domain,  if applicable. We invite you to explore the collection, discover new tools, and help update/maintain listings [via GitHub pull request](https://github.com/dataviz-cafe/contribute/pulls).

## Submitting new entries via PR in YAML

We're always looking to keep the collection current. If you believe a certain open source visualization tool should be included, please check [https://dataviz.cafe](https://dataviz.cafe/) first and then open a pull request to add it to [newentry.yml](new_entry.yml).
