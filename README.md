[Dataviz.cafe](https://dataviz.cafe/) is a searchable catalog of free and open-source (FOSS) data visualization software. With over 700 software packages tagged with capability-specific keywords, it is designed to help analysts, data scientists, and designers use FOSS in their work.

From general-purpose frameworks to specialized libraries for visualizing brain structures, satellite orbits, and electrical grids (to name just a few), dataviz.cafe is designed to help people find high quality, low-cost visualization resources to support a wide variety of use-cases. We invite you to explore the collection, discover new tools, and help update/maintain listings [via GitHub pull request](https://github.com/dataviz-cafe/contribute/pulls).

:mag: Key features
-----------
Dataviz.cafe organizes software packages into five categories based on the type of data they visualize: geospatial, network, quantitative, text, and miscellaneous. Tools that span multiple data types are cross-listed under all applicable categories.

Visitors to [dataviz.cafe](https://dataviz.cafe/) can explore the entire collection or filter results by data type. Alternatively, they can use the search bar to find visualization authoring tools optimized for a particular programming language, API, chart type, data encoding format, or keyword. Along with software-specific tags, every listing includes:  
1. the name of the tool, along with a link to the tool’s official website/code repository,
2. a representative image or screenshot to demonstrate the software’s basic output/functionality,
3. a summary of the tool’s purpose, programming language, and primary capabilities,
4. the total number of GitHub stars the package has received, as a proxy for popularity in the FOSS community, and
5. the software license type, for users to determine license compatibility.
